 "title": "Local storage tests",
 "bodyMarkdown": "I've been encountering two problems regarding the tests for the local storage.\r\n\r\nFirst, the test \"localStorage should contain Array of game results\" sometimes failed for me because all the times were null (whereas player and score were always initialized). I found that this was because if certain tests are too fast, a new Game will be created, but not started. Therefore, time will not be initialized, and getElapsedTime() will return undefined. I tried to correct it by modifying stopGame():\r\n\r\n```\r\n    stopGame() {\r\n        this.running = false;\r\n        clearInterval(this.timer);\r\n\r\n        if (this.time == undefined) this.time = performance.now();\r\n        document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent(\"game.over\", { detail:\r\n            /* Quiz 7 */\r\n            { player: this.player,\r\n               score: this.score,\r\n                time: this.getElapsedTime() }\r\n        }));\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is one example of a test where a Game is initialized, but not started:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here](https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/usi-itinf/images/s/c5f63a20-0890-4357-89de-c7b6c64c3f0e.png)](https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/usi-itinf/images/s/c5f63a20-0890-4357-89de-c7b6c64c3f0e.png)\r\n\r\nAnother problem was regarding the last test. Here, the problem is that sometimes a previous test generated so many results with values so high, that high_scores already has more than 10 elements (see the image to see a console.log).\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here](https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/usi-itinf/images/s/99e5edf9-14e6-4c08-9b0b-e92f49621dde.png)](https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/usi-itinf/images/s/99e5edf9-14e6-4c08-9b0b-e92f49621dde.png)\r\n\r\nThen, the new elements generated in the test will never be displayed. My idea was to add a slice at the beginning of the test to restrict the maximum size of the array:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        it(\"<aside> or <sidebar> content should change after adding high score results\", function (done) {\r\n\r\n            getHighScore((localStorage, high_scores, doc, w) => {\r\n                try {\r\n\r\n                    let e = doc.querySelector(\"aside\") || doc.querySelector(\"sidebar\");\r\n\r\n                    let old_content = e.innerHTML;\r\n\r\n                    high_scores = high_scores || \"[]\";\r\n\r\n                    high_scores = JSON.parse(high_scores);\r\n                    high_scores = high_scores.slice(0, 5);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI wanted to both warn of this situation and ask if the proposed changes are valid.",
 "body": "<p>I've been encountering two problems regarding the tests for the local storage.</p>\n<p>First, the test &quot;localStorage should contain Array of game results&quot; sometimes failed for me because all the times were null (whereas player and score were always initialized). I found that this was because if certain tests are too fast, a new Game will be created, but not started. Therefore, time will not be initialized, and getElapsedTime() will return undefined. I tried to correct it by modifying stopGame():</p>\n<pre><code>    stopGame() {\n        this.running = false;\n        clearInterval(this.timer);\n\n        if (this.time == undefined) this.time = performance.now();\n        document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent(&quot;game.over&quot;, { detail:\n            /* Quiz 7 */\n            { player: this.player,\n               score: this.score,\n                time: this.getElapsedTime() }\n        }));\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here is one example of a test where a Game is initialized, but not started:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/usi-itinf/images/s/c5f63a20-0890-4357-89de-c7b6c64c3f0e.png\"><img src=\"https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/usi-itinf/images/s/c5f63a20-0890-4357-89de-c7b6c64c3f0e.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>Another problem was regarding the last test.
